The Raft consensus algorithm is a distributed consensus protocol designed to manage replicated state machines in a distributed system. Its primary goal is to ensure that a group of nodes (servers) agree on a sequence of commands or actions in a way that maintains consistency and fault tolerance, even in the face of network failures and node crashes.

Here's how the Raft algorithm works:

1. **Leader Election**: The cluster starts in a neutral state. To begin, nodes participate in a leader election process. They exchange "heartbeat" messages, and if a node hasn't received a heartbeat for a certain time, it assumes the leader is down and starts a new leader election. Nodes with the most up-to-date log become candidates and request votes from others. The first candidate to receive votes from a majority becomes the new leader.

2. **Log Replication**: Once a leader is elected, it serves as the central coordinator for the cluster's decisions. Clients send commands to the leader, which appends them to its log and broadcasts the log entries to the other nodes. Nodes then add these entries to their logs and acknowledge their receipt.

3. **Consistency**: To ensure consistency, a log entry is considered committed when the leader has received acknowledgements from a majority of nodes. Once committed, the leader notifies the other nodes, and they apply the command to their state machines in the same order. This guarantees that all nodes reach the same state through the same sequence of commands.

4. **Leader Failure**: In the event of leader failure, nodes detect this absence through heartbeat timeouts. When the leader is no longer reachable, nodes initiate a new leader election process to select a new leader. The candidate with the most up-to-date log entries and majority votes becomes the new leader, allowing the cluster to continue functioning.

5. **Log Compaction**: Over time, logs can grow large. To manage this, Raft supports log compaction, where a leader and its followers agree on a snapshot of the system state and discard log entries before that snapshot. This reduces the storage and processing requirements for older data.

In summary, the Raft algorithm provides a clear separation of roles (leader and followers), ensures consistency through majority-based agreement on log entries, and handles leader failures through periodic leader election processes. This approach simplifies the complexities of achieving consensus in distributed systems while maintaining reliability, fault tolerance, and recoverability.
