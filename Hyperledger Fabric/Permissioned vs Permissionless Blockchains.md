In a **permissionless blockchain**, virtually anyone can participate, and every participant is anonymous. In such a context, there can be no trust other than that the state of the blockchain, prior to a certain depth, is immutable. Public Blockchain like Ethereum, Bitcoin are examples of permissioned blockchain. To provide economic incentive to offset the extraordinary costs of participating in a form of byzantine fault tolerant consensus based on “proof of work” (PoW).

**Permissioned** blockchains, on the other hand, operate a blockchain amongst a set of known, identified and often vetted participants operating under a governance model that yields a certain degree of trust. By relying on the identities of the participants, a permissioned blockchain can use more traditional crash fault tolerant (CFT) or byzantine fault tolerant (BFT) consensus protocols that do not require costly mining.
